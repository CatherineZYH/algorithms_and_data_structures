    "For my process from assignment 1 question 3, firstly, I have read the question deeply and ensure fully understood the requirements. Secondly, I started to use what I have learnt from courses to write the code by creating a set of the complete range and comparing it with the set of given number to come up the solution that found the missing numbers. Thirdly. I tested and validated the solution with the provided examples to ensure correctness. Fourthly, in order to further demonstrate understanding, I created additional examples with different scenarios, including cases with duplicates and all identical numbers to ensure the solution is correct. Fifthly, I have explored an alternative approach using a boolean array for potential memory efficiency, especially for large ranges. To sum up, this assignment helps me to better understand the process of finding the most effective solutions through multiple testing.\n",

    "For reviewing the partner's assignment question 1, I have learnt and understood the solution to find duplicate values in a binary tree. Firstly, I reviewed the given solution and identified some minor issues, such as the use of a mutable default argument. Secondly, I have created a new example to ensure I fully understand the problem and partner's coding logics. Thirdly, through critiquing the solution and suggesting an adjustment, I ensured my suggestion is actually solving the potential issues. To sum up, the reviewing partner's work process helped me reinforce my knowledge of binary tree traversal and recursion while also practicing code review and debugging skills. Collaborating with a partner allowed for valuable feedback and deeper insights into potential improvements, and this experience also enhanced my problem-solving abilities."
